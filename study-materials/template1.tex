\textbf{Collaborators:} I collaborated with the following students on
this assignment: <Insert Names Here>


\subsection*{Problem 1}

Suppose $p$ is a prime and $g$ and $h$ are both generators of
$Z_p^*$. Prove or disprove the following statements about equality
of probability distributions:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\textbf{A:} & \ \ \ \ \ &
\{x \leftarrow Z_p^*: g^x \mod p\} = \{x \leftarrow Z_p^*; y \leftarrow Z_p^*: g^{xy} \mod p\} \\
\textbf{B:} & \ \ \ \ \ &
\{x \leftarrow Z_p^*: g^x \mod p\} = \{x \leftarrow Z_p^*: h^{x} \mod p\} \\
\textbf{C:} & \ \ \ \ \ &
\{x \leftarrow Z_p^*: g^x \mod p\} = \{x \leftarrow Z_p^*: x^g \mod p\} \\
\textbf{D:} & \ \ \ \ \ &
\{x \leftarrow Z_p^*: x^g \mod p\} = \{x \leftarrow Z_p^*: x^{gh} \mod p\} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection*{Problem 2}
Suppose that the Prime Discrete Logarithm Problem is easy. That is,
suppose that there exists a probabilistic, polynomial time algorithm
$A$ that, on inputs $p$, $g$ and $g^x \mod p$,  outputs $x$ if $p$
is a prime, $g$ is a generator of $Z_p^*$ and $g^x \mod p$ is prime.
Show that there exists a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm,
$B$, that solves the Discrete Logarithm Problem.

\newpage

\subsection*{Problem 3 }

We define the Lily problem as: given two integers $n$ and $S$
determine whether $S$ is relatively prime to $\phi(n)$. Prove that
if it is hard to determine on inputs two integers $n$ and $e$
whether $e$ is relatively prime with $\phi(n)$, then  the RSA
function is hard to invert.

\newpage

\subsection*{Problem 4: Factoring }

Let $O_n$ be an oracle that on input $x$ returns a square root of $x
\mod n$, if one exists, and $\bot$ otherwise. Prove that there
exists a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm that on input an
integer $n$ and access to  $O_n$ outputs $n$'s factorization.

\newpage

\subsection*{Problem 5: Factoring and OWF (OPTIONAL)}

Prove that if factoring is hard, then one-way
  functions (as defined in class) exist.
